Dear C4T Parent,

Your child, YYYYY, has successfully made it into the class XXXXX! We are looking forward to teaching your child this year and to help strengthen their skills in coding. 

Please have your child create a Discord account, and have them join our Discord Server with this link: https://discord.gg/S2JYP9j - this is mandatory for all students. Also, please ensure that your child follows the instructions in the #welcome channel (also found here, https://discord.code4tomorrow.org/get-started/setup), otherwise they will automatically be removed (“kicked”) from the server at 12 AM PT for the security of verified users on the server.

We will be using Discord to allow for smooth communication between students, teachers, and C4T administrators. For more information on how we use Discord, please consult our Discord Guide found here: https://discord.code4tomorrow.org. Students can easily find meeting information for their classes again by using the +classinfo <code> command once they have finished setup instructions on the Discord server, or by navigating to the Pinned Messages of the #<code> private channel. 

If you have any questions specific to this class, please email classes@code4tomorrow.org. DO NOT reply to this email, as this is autogenerated. While we do check our emails regularly, you can also message us in the #questions channel on our Discord Server (linked above) for generally faster responses. Be sure to include your child’s full name and class code(s) in your inquiries - this will help speed up the process.

We are so excited for this coding journey! We look forward to seeing you soon!

Regards,

The Code 4 Tomorrow Team
