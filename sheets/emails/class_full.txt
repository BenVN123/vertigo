Dear C4T Parent,

We are sorry to inform you that your child, YYYYY, has unfortunately not made it into the requested class XXXXX, as it has reached full capacity. However, you may submit another class code so that you child may have an opportunity to enroll in one of the other amazing classes we offer here at Code 4 Tomorrow! Although we are very sorry for the inconvenience, we look forward to hearing back from you soon!

Regards,
The Code 4 Tomorrow Team
