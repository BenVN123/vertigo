      Dear C4T Parent,
    </p>
    <p>
      Your child, YYYYY, has successfully made it into the class <b>XXXXX</b>!
      We are looking forward to teaching your child this year and to help
      strengthen their skills in coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please have your child create a Discord account, and have them join our
      Discord Server by clicking <a href="https://discord.gg/S2JYP9j">here</a> -
      this is mandatory for all students. Also, please ensure that your child
      follows the <a href="https://discord.code4tomorrow.org/get-started/setup">
      instructions</a> in the <b>#welcome</b> channel, otherwise they will
      automatically be removed (“kicked”) from the server at 12 AM PT for the
      security of verified users on the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be using Discord to allow for smooth communication between
      students, teachers, and C4T administrators. For more information on how
      we use Discord, please consult our <a href="https://discord.code4tomorrow.org">Discord Guide.</a>
      Students can easily find meeting information for their classes again by using the
      <b>+classinfo XXXXX</b> command <i>once they have finished setup instructions</i>
      on the Discord server, or by navigating to the <b>Pinned Messages of the XXXXX
      private channel.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any questions specific to this class, please email
      <b>classes@code4tomorrow.org. DO NOT reply to this email,</b> as this is
      autogenerated. While we do check our emails regularly, you can also
      message us in the <b>#questions</b> channel on our Discord Server (linked
      above) for generally faster responses. Be sure to <b>include your child’s
      full name and class code(s)</b> in your inquiries - this will help speed
      up the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are so excited for this coding journey! We look forward to seeing you soon!
    </p>
    <p>
      Regards,
    </p>
