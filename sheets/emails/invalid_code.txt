Dear C4T Parent,

We are sorry to inform you that your child, YYYYY, has not made it into the requested class due to XXXXX being an invalid class code. We would request that you double check the class code requested with the ones listed on our website so that they match. If they do not, make sure to email us again with the correct class code and we will try to enroll your child in the corresponding class. If, for some reason, the class codes do match, then we would request that you email us again with a different class code, as that class may no longer be available. Although we are very sorry for the inconvenience, we hope to hear back from you soon!

Regards,
The Code 4 Tomorrow Team
