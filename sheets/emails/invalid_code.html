      Dear C4T Parent,
    </p>
    <p>
      We are sorry to inform you that your child, YYYYY, has not made it into
      the requested class due to <b>XXXXX</b> being an invalid class code. We
      would request that you double check the class code requested with the ones
      listed on our website so that they match. If they do not, make sure to
      email us again with the correct class code and we will try to enroll your
      child in the corresponding class. If, for some reason, the class codes do
      match, then we would request that you email us again with a different class
      code, as that class may no longer be available. Although we are very sorry for
      the inconvenience, we hope to hear back from you soon!
    </p>
    <p>
      Regards,
    </p>
